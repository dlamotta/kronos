Kronos is a Kong Gateway plugin that allows users to execute native commands on the host which is running the gateway.
It implements a strategy pattern, so different strategies can be used to invoke different commands on the host. 
The example strategy exposes a Perl Pig Latin translator that would otherwise only be accessible through a terminal.
